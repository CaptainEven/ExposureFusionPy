# Exposure Fusion
Exposure Fusion Technique
This code implements the Exposure Fusion, a Low-Dynamic-Range technique. It blends multi-exposure sequence of photo into a high-quality image, and is guided by measurement as Contrast, Saturation and Well-exposedness.

You can find the Research paper where the algorithm comes from [here](https://github.com/Rachine/ExposureFusion/blob/master/exposure_fusion.pdf) [1]

This code used python3 and the packages Opencv, Numpy and SciPy.
